# The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN, a and b. Add code to print three lines where:

# The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
# The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
# The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))

c = a+b
d = a-b
e = a*b

print(c,"\n")
print(d,"\n")
