# The provided code stub reads two integers, a and b, from STDIN.

# Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division, a // b. The second line should contain the result of float division, a / b.

# No rounding or formatting is necessary.

a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))

c = a//b
d = a/b

print(c)
