## Task

Given an integer, n perform the following conditional actions:

If n is odd, print Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5 , print Not Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird
Input Format

A single line containing a positive integer, .

## Constraints

1<=n<=100

## Output Format

Print Weird if the number is weird; otherwise, print Not Weird.

### Sample Input 0

```
3
```

### Sample Output 0

```
Weird
```

### Explanation 0

n=3
n is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print Weird.

### Sample Input 1

```
24
```

### Sample Output 1

```
Not Weird
```

### Explanation 1

n = 24
n > 20 and n is even, so it isn't weird. Thus, we print Not Weird.
