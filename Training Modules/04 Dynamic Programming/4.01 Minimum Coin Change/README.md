### Objective
Given a amount "A" and n coins, v1 < ... < vn. Write a program to find out minimum numbers of coins required to make the change for the amount "A".

### Example
>Amount: 5 
Coins: [1, 2, 3]
List of ways to make the change are : { 1,1,1,1,1} , {1,1,1,2}, {2,2,1},{1,1,3} and {3,2}.
So as we can see minimum number of coins required are 2 ( 3+2 ) = 5.
