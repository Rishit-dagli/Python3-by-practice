Problem:
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous
two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

    1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,..

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed
n, find the sum of the even-valued terms. e.g. for n=10, we have {2,8}, sum is
10.
