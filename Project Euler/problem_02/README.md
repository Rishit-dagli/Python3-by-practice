### Problem Statement :
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two
terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

    1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,..

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed
n, find the sum of the even-valued terms. e.g. for n=10, we have {2,8}, sum is
10.

Sample Test Case:
 
 Input - 10<br>
 Output - 10

 Input - 15<br>
 Output - 10
  
 Input - 2<br>
 Output - 2
 
 Input - 1<br>
 Output - 0

Input - 34<br>
Output - 44
