### Problem Statement:
#### Title : Sum square difference
#### Description :
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is :    
1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385  
The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is :     
(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10)^2 = 3025     
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is,
(3025 - 385) = 2640     
Then,Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum amd so on ...
