This is a simple program that generates qr codes for the data provided. You can easily fine tune the code to suit the data you are using.
 
Consider the following use case to understand how we can use this.
 
## Event Invitation 
Ever organised a hackathon or maybe been in one? Ever waited in ques to get yourself registered for the event? Many of us have been there and can agree that managing crowds can get a bit hard at times.
Generally the event organisers issue ID cards to each participant that has their Name,team Name, IdNumber etc that they cross reference with the list they to give refreshments, swags and various other goodies
What if instead of using people we could just have a program to the above tasks ensuring that everyone gets what they paid for.
